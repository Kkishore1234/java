4 and 5

 What will be the Output of the below code:

public class A { 

    public static void main(String[] args) 

    { 

        if (true) 

            break; 

    } 
} 

class Base { 

    protected void foo() {} 
}  

class Derived extends Base { 

    void foo() {} 
}  

public class Main { 

    public static void main(String args[]) { 

        Derived d = new Derived(); 

        d.foo(); 

    } 
}

The break statement is used outside of a loop or switch statement in the first part, and there is an extra public class declaration in the third part. Both of these issues will result in compilation errors.
